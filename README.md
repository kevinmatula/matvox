# ⬡ Matvox
Matvox is an efficient, terminal-based voxel engine. All graphics are rendered with ASCII characters on the CPU.

## ⛏ Features
- 🎮 **Free movement**: Allows users to roam freely around a space with their keyboard and mouse.
- ⚡ **CPU-optimized rendering**: Comes out of the box with various performance optimizations, such as face culling.
- 🧠 **Sparse pixel allocation**: Only allocates memory for pixels that are on the screen, optimizing runtime and space complexity.
- 🌫 **ASCII depth shading**: Creates the illusion of depth by using characters with more visual density (like "@") to represent closeness, and characters with less visual density (like ".") to represent distance.

## 🤯 Design
- Why did I make this object oriented !?

## 📚 Documentation & Notes

## 🚧 Future Ideas
- Port this project to the worst hardware imaginable (PS1, 3DS, and more) to evaluate performance.
